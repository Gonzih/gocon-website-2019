    "description": "Ever written a REST API server? but even to just add a single endpoint to a service is a lot of work to coordinate and then implement across different api client libraries and apps. Webrpc offers a schema-driven approach to writing Web services, declare your data types and methods in a documentation-like format called RIDL, and use the webrpc-gen cli to generate your bindings between client+server for Go, Javascript, Typescript and other languages. Think of it like a lighter/simpler gRPC made for the Web.",
