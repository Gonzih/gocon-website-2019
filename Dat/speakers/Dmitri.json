    "description": "Go 1.11 introduced a new concept called modules, an alternative to GOPATH with support for versioning and reproducible builds. This talk aims to provide a conceptual model about how modules operate by explaining them from an abstract and a low-level technical perspective. It should give you a better idea of what happens when you run commands like go build or go mod tidy, and help inform your decisions when using and publishing modules.",

        "Coming from a game development and graphics/UI background where C++ was used predominantly, he discovered and made a full switch to Go six years ago, which lead to increased developer happiness.",
        "In his spare time, he's mostly working on software development tools and exploring experimental ideas. He enjoys contributing to open source, fixing issues in existing tools and the Go project itself."
